This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app and involves an issue with the Android Gradle Plugin version compatibility.  The error message might not be entirely clear, but often points to conflicts in versions or missing dependencies related to AndroidX.  Specifically, the error might manifest as build failures with messages hinting at missing classes or version inconsistencies related to libraries like `androidx.appcompat` or other AndroidX components.

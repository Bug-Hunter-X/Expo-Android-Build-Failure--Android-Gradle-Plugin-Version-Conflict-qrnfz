The solution involves carefully reviewing and potentially modifying the `android/app/build.gradle` file.  The specific changes needed depend on the exact error message, but generally involve the following steps:

1. **Verify Gradle Plugin Version:** Ensure your `build.gradle` file uses a compatible AGP version. Check the Expo documentation for the recommended version.
2. **Check AndroidX Dependencies:** Ensure that all necessary AndroidX dependencies are included and that there are no conflicts between them.  Look for any outdated or incompatible AndroidX libraries.
3. **Clean and Rebuild:** After making changes to `build.gradle`, try cleaning and rebuilding the project.  Run `./gradlew clean` and then `expo build:android` again.
4. **Dependency Resolution:** If the problem persists, carefully examine the dependency tree using the Gradle command `./gradlew app:dependencies`.  This will highlight any potential conflicts or inconsistencies.
5. **Consult Expo Documentation:** Refer to the official Expo documentation for troubleshooting guidance and known issues related to Android builds.  Pay close attention to version compatibility information for AGP and other components.

Example Code Snippet (Illustrative - Changes needed will be context-specific):

```gradle
// In android/app/build.gradle
dependencies {
    implementation "androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.6.1"
    // ... other dependencies
}
```

By carefully examining and adjusting the dependency configuration in `android/app/build.gradle`, the build errors can typically be resolved.
